                <h2>Digitalize Co-op and Work Placement Forms (Capstone)</h2>
                <p>
                    This project digitalized the Co-op and Work Placement forms using Microsoft Forms and Power Automate. 
                    Together with 3 other classmates, we aimed to streamline the process for students, faculty, and Industry partners,
                    reducing the time and improving the efficency of completing these forms.

                    <h3>Background History</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project was put forth due to the frustration that students and faculty were having with the Co-op and
                        Workplace Learning forms. The fedback my group received from shareholders, showed a dislike to the process of 
                        completing these forms, which gave us the green light to begin digitalizing and creating a new simplier way for 
                        these forms to be filled out and submitted by all parties. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Future Steps / Upgrades</h3>
                    <p>
                        Although I have since completed my Capstone class, there are a few future upgrades that I would like to see being 
                        implemented. One of those upgrades would be the continued creation of the rest of the forms that Faculty and Students 
                        fill out throughout the year, including International Student Co-op forms. Another future upgrade I would like to see 
                        implemented would be better integration with the NSCC database that would allow for auto-fill in data like the students 
                        name and email, simply by entering the students ID.

                <h2>React.js Mobile WordPress app for Android/iOS</h2>
                <p>
                    This project involved creating a cross-platform mobile app for Android and iOS, using React.js and Expo. This was created 
                    by integrating the WordPress API, and allows users to create and publish posts on their mobile devices. The user is able to include 
                    images, titles, descriptions, and categories which allows for a very personalized and user-friendly experience. C# was used to handle 
                    API requests, ensuring smooth communication between the app and the WordPress site.

                    <p>
                        This project originated as an assignment in my Emerging Technologies class, which showcased technologies and tools that are 
                        on the rise in the IT world. This app was created using React Native and utilized Expo Go to create a fun way for the app user to 
                        make posts on a WordPress site. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Future Steps / Upgrades</h3>
                    <p>
                        Future steps for this app may include the use of notifications that the user can view, and also inplement an offline mode where users 
                        could post drafts without an internet connection, where the user could then make their posts at a later time.

                <h2>Dungeons & Dragons Style Desktop Game (Java)</h2>
                <p>
                    This project is a Java based desktop application inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, and allows users to customize their experience in the game by 
                    naming their warrior, choosing one of three unique character models, and selecting their weapon of choice. The game then allows for randomized player stats
                    to be created, and allows the player to re-roll for a chance at better stats. Players then engage in battles with monsters to see who the winner is. 
                </p>

                    <h3>Background History</h3>
                    <p>
                        This game stemmes from a project propossed at school, and aimed to create a game similar to Dungeons and Dragons that would allow for desktop gameplay
                        using Java and IntelliJ IDEA.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Future Steps / Upgrades</h3>
                    <p>
                        Due to time limitations, the game was no flushed out and completed as much as I wouldve liked, so improvements to the amount of characters, weapons, and 
                        skills could be a future improvement. I would also like the addition of multiplayer, where you could have a friend join in to help defeat the monsters in 
                        the game.
